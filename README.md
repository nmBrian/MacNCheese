# **Mac N' Cheese!!**
Macaroni and cheese—also called mac 'n' cheese in the United States, and macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom[1]—is a dish of cooked macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar. It can also incorporate other ingredients, such as breadcrumbs or meat.

Traditional macaroni and cheese is a casserole baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix. The cheese is often first incorporated into a Béchamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is then added to the pasta. In the United States, it is considered a comfort food.

- 2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
